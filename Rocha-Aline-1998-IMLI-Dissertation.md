## 1. Introduction

The importance of the sea goes back long time ago. Some people perceived it and used the sea as a route of navigation with the aim of trading, searching out new opportunities and obtaining new conquests. History demonstrates that those people always were in a more favourable position than the others who never had the courage to leave the safety of terra firma and face the perils of the sea.

The sea served and has been serving mankind as a source of food, route of navigation, way of communication, dumping of waste from land, barrier, battlefield, etc. Recently the technological development has granted the exploration and exploitation of its natural resources. The sea is therefore a stage where various, deep and often antagonistic interests meet.

The most recent effort to codify the law for the use of the seas was made by the United Nations. After many sessions in the period 1973-1982, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has been described as the single most important diplomatic event since the creation of the United Nations, adopted a convention on 30 April, 1982.

The United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea represents not only the most ambitious scheme of codification of customary norms, but also and more significantly the progressive development of international law ever attempted.

The Convention was open for signature from 10 December, 1982 to 9 December, 1984. At that time, 159 States and other entities (referred to in Article 305) signed the Convention. This is the highest number of signatures of any multilateral treaty. As at 16 November, 1997, 122 States have established their consent to be bound by the Convention, 111 instruments of ratification and 11 instruments of accession and succession have been deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.[^1]

This marked the culmination of over 14 years of work involving participation by more than 150 countries representing all regions of the world, all legal and political systems, all degrees of socio-economic development, countries with various dispositions regarding the kinds of minerals that can be found in the sea-bed, coastal States, archipelagic States, island States and land-locked States. These countries convened for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive regime "dealing with all matters relating to the law of the sea, .... bearing in mind that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole."[^2]

Having received the required number (60) of ratifications or accessions, the Convention entered into force on November 1994. Of these 60 States, 27 belong to the group of African States, 11 to the Asian group and 19 to the group of Latin American and Caribbean States. The three remaining States are European.

About one hundred of the States which have established their consent to be bound by the Convention are developing States. Some industrialized States have expressed dissatisfaction with some of the terms of Part XI of the Convention and this led them to refrain from ratifying or acceding to the Convention, particularly in view of the world economic situation that had changed fundamentally since the early 1980s.[^3]

## 2. The Legal Significance of the 1982 Convention on the Law of Sea

Even before the Convention had entered into force, many Governments had already taken measures to implement the rules embodied therein. A great number of coastal States adopted new legislation particularly on the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone, setting their limits at 12 and 200 miles respectively, even before 1982, as the consensus on these and other issues began to emerge at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.

That process generated patterns of consistent State practice which, in turn, formed rules of customary international law, as well as influenced the work of international organizations and the decisions of international tribunals.

One factor that has undoubtedly contributed to these positive developments was the unique working method adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The method of working by way of consensus meant that debates, especially on key issues, were spread over several sessions and held in both committees and working groups, both official and unofficial. As a result, the discussions were inevitably prolonged, but the texts which finally resulted had the valuable quality of being negotiated texts, which took due account of the legitimate concerns and interests of different States. Under such circumstances, Governments were more willing to incorporate in their national legislation the rules set forth in the Convention, accepting the burden as well as the benefit of the balanced provisions of the Convention.[^4]

The legal significance of the Convention, and the "Working Paper" or "Draft Convention"[^5], which for long represented the provisional outcome of the Conference, has to be considered at several different levels. In the first place, the more technical and normative aspects of the Working Paper or Draft Convention had, prior to the adoption of the Convention in April, 1982, already played a role in precipitating or reinforcing certain tendencies in customary or general international law.

Thus, the state of general international law in respect of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone has been determined in varying degrees by the normative aspects of the Working Paper produced by the various sessions of the Conference. Evidence of this is to be seen, for example, in the Judgment of the International Court in the Tunisia-Libya Continental Shelf Case.[^6]

The normative - as opposed to the institutional - aspects of the Convention fall into two, sometime overlapping, categories. First, certain provisions, such as the material concerning the territorial sea, are very similar to rules previously recognized by convention or State codification. In other cases, as for example in the provisions concerning the exclusive economic zone, the draft articles have been influencing State practice: and thus informal prescriptions (the provisional text of the draft Convention and [now] the text of a convention which had not yet entered into force until 1994 and then only for the ratifying States) have a catalytic effect.

A further issue concerns the role of provisions of the new Convention as evidence of general international law in disputes involving States which are not parties to the Convention. This was the issue, in the context of the Continental Shelf Convention of 1958, in the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases.[^7]

There are a certain number of normative provisions in the new Convention which are not repetitions of well-recognized principles, but are arguably either declaratory of pre-existing custom or attractive enough to be imitated by the practice of States. A connected and highly controversial matter is the question to what extent, if at all, the treaty regime of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction[^8] is an objective regime opposable to third States.[^9]

## 3. Latin America and the Development of the Law of the Sea: An Overview

Latin American attitudes towards the development of the law of the sea cannot be correctly understood unless placed in a politico-economic perspective. Historically speaking, the drama of Latin America has been its chronic inability, individually or collectively, to assert an effective political, economic, and legal independence. From Bolivar to the faltering exercises in economic integration, the centrifugal forces of political, economic, and cultural diversity have persistently frustrated all attempts to create a viable Latin America identity. In the legal field, Latin American initiatives in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to modify the status quo, such as the Drago doctrine and the calvo clause, were effectively isolated and stifled by the european powers and the United States, while the elaborate inter-American legal system is considered by some to be overly abstract and bearing little or no relationship to the political, economical, and sociological realities of contemporary Latin America.[^10]

Since 1945, the Latin American States have created a considerable body of practice and doctrine on all aspects of the law of the sea. The most important, and controversial source of this Latin American doctrine consisted of unilateral acts - legislation, decrees, declarations - which had been consistently enforced by Latin American States, frequently in the face of protests by foreign governments.

The cornerstone of the Latin American approach to the law of the sea is the nexus between the sea and the land. In geographic or economic terms, this is most easily understood by reference to the immense coastlines of many Latin American States[^11] or to the living and mineral resources of the sea. It is interesting to appreciate the psychological aspect of this nexus, familiar to island nations such as the United Kingdom and Iceland but not normally associated with large land-mass States such as Argentina, Chile, Peru or Brazil. This psychological factor has an important bearing on Latin American attitudes giving rise to what many Latin American States regard as the essential unity of the zones within national jurisdiction: the territorial sea, zones of special jurisdiction, and the continental shelf. The translation of this essential unity into a new legal concept was one of the principal Latin American objectives in the law of the sea conference.

The present chapter is an attempt to present a general overview of the development in Latin America, to identify the positions adopted, and to delineate the Latin American consensus - a consensus which exerted an important influence on the final outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.

### 3.1 The Territorial Sea - Moves to Set Seaward Limits

The sea has been the focus of innumerable controversy giving rise to an evolution in which the territorial sea appeared as an issue of great relevance.

Historically, the fundamental problem of the law of the sea has been the delimitation of the frontier between the territorial sea and the high seas. After the historic doctrinal clash between Grotius and Selden in the seventeenth century, international law gradually evolved toward a customary rule based on the range of a cannon which, at the time, was approximately one marine league or three miles.[^12]

For centuries the main limit, the breadth of the territorial sea, was set for security reasons at three or four miles. This "neutrality zone" was kept narrow because it suited the maritime powers. Sovereignty over a three-mile territorial sea, coupled with the regime of freedom of navigation on the high seas, where the "twin pillards" upon which the European colonial powers built their empires.[^13]

A logical extension of this system was the legal device known as "flag state jurisdiction". This gave ships of any State the protection of the flag they flew, wherever they were, even inside the territorial sea of another State if they were exercising the right of innocent passage.

This rule enjoyed a lengthy period of stability until 1930, when the League of Nations' attempt to codify it failed. In fact, until the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea there has been no conventional law - but the customary cannon-shot rule - regulating the breadth of the territorial sea.

During the current century three international conferences attempted to define the breadth of the territorial sea. The three Conferences that took place in 1930, in Hague, and in 1958 and 1960, in Geneva, did not succeed. After much debate between proponents of a 3 nautical mile limit to the territorial sea and proponents of an extended territorial sea, the 1958 Conference on the Law of the Sea failed to establish a uniform limit to the breadth of the territorial sea. The 1960 Conference also failed to agree on its limit.

An increasing number of States extended their claims of a territorial sea in the 1960s and 1970s from three miles up to as much as 200 miles. The need for a uniform limit to the breadth of territorial sea was again the subject of much debate in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The Conference finally accepted a limit of twelve nautical miles.[^14]

Three kinds of reasons - security (strategic and military), economic and environmental - have prompted moves to set seaward limits. When war broke out in Europe in September 1939, President Roosevelt proposed a "neutrality zone" around the Americas (excluding Canada), and foreign ministers at an Inter-American meeting agreed to the idea of demarcating and patrolling this zone. They stated this in the Declaration of Panama. The geographers in the US State Department drew circles of 300 miles radius from shore round the Americas, and the President added straight lines connecting the outermost points; so that in some places the zone extended nearly 500 miles from shore.[^15]

The move was largely ineffectual. Within months the Battle of the River Plate took place off Uruguay, and by December 1941 the United States was in the war. But this neutrality zone became at least a stepfather of the 200-mile patrimonial sea.

During the 1950s the nuclear weapon powers of the west frequently appropriated large areas of the Pacific for their bomb tests in the atmosphere, clearing the zones of shipping. Meanwhile, more domestic security reasons - control of smuggling, immigration and customs - were behind the creation of 12-mile "contiguous zones".

Economic reasons began to surface in 1945 with the Truman Proclamations asserting US control over the natural resources of its continental shelf and claiming the right to establish fishery conservation zones.[^16] The claims that followed by Latin American States were justified on economic grounds. Similarly, the 1958 Geneva Convention delimitation of the continental shelf, the 200-meter depth of water or the "limits of exploitability", was couched in terms to suit the oil companies as much as the geologists.

Prior to 1945, the division of the sea into the territorial sea and the high seas, with an overlapping contiguous zone, had been accepted. Ironically, it was the United States, one of the staunchest supporters of the 3 nautical mile territorial sea doctrine, that opened an era of extensive maritime claims.[^17]

President Truman issued two proclamations, the catalytic effect of which was not due solely to the United States' political weight but also to the rapid developments in the exploitation techniques of the sea-bed and fisheries. Through the Proclamation with respect to the Natural Resources of the Subsoil and Sea-bed of the Continental Shelf, the United States claimed the natural resources of the subsoil and sea-bed of the shelf "beneath the high seas but contiguous to its coasts", to be "subject to its jurisdiction and control". While no outer shelf boundary was specified, an accompanying White House release indicated a 100-fathom isobath (200 meters) as determinative of the limit, a move clearly intended to prevent other States from approaching closer to the coasts of the United States for the purpose of exploiting submarine mineral resources.[^18]

Through the Proclamation with respect to Coastal Fisheries in Certain Areas of the High Seas, the United States proposed the establishment of fishery-conservation zones in waters contiguous to its coasts but beyond the 3 nautical mile territorial sea. These zones were to be regulated and controlled by the United States where fishing was carried out by nationals, and by joint State management where nationals of other countries were also engaged in fishing activities. The Proclamations emphasized that the character as high seas of the waters above the shelf or the area in which conservation zones are established "and the right of their free and unimpeded navigation are in no way thus affected ...".[^19]

It is noteworthy that the second Proclamation was never applied. Nevertheless, the introduction of these Proclamations marked a turning-point in the law of the sea by encouraging other States to establish extensive maritime claims. They afforded the plausible grounds for enlarging States' offshore control.[^20]

Environmental reasons for setting limits came last. It is true that many coastal States have tried to enforce "sanitary regulations" when they have established as 12-mile contiguous zone. But it was not until Canada passed the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act in 1970, declaring control over a zone of 100 nautical miles around the Canadian coast in Arctic waters, that any State gave environmental reasons for asserting jurisdiction off its coasts.[^21]

Latin American States swiftly took their cue from Truman Proclamations to protect their preferential fishing rights and to preserve a major economic resource. Several of them went further and combined elements of the two Proclamations in claiming sovereignty over the waters above the shelf, or else fisheries jurisdiction up to 200 miles offshore.

### 3.2 Latin America Position Prior to the Convention

In contrast with the Truman Proclamations, most Latin American States revived the earliest formulations of the "doctrine of the continental shelf", and claimed sovereignty over the shelf and the waters above. Indeed, the first introduction of the shelf concept in international law discussions was based on the theory that the waters above the shelf were of the utmost importance to fisheries.[^22] The shelf theory served as a basis for the early Latin American claims to an epicontinental sea, thereby discarding the approach which differentiated between living and non-living resources.[^23]

The most distinctive position with regard to the breadth of the territorial sea is that which is generally identified with Latin America. Dissatisfaction with the classical three-mile rule was first manifested by a number of Latin American States at the 1930 Hague Conference for the codification of International Law, when the League of Nations' attempt to codify it failed.

#### (A) Unilateral Claims

The Mexican Executive, in its proposed 1945 amendment to the Constitution, Article 27, held that:

> Direct dominion over the continental shelf and the submarine terraces belong to the nation ... the water of the seas over the continental shelf and submarine terraces are also the property of the nation ....[^24]

In 1946, Argentina issued Decree No. 14.708 concerning National Sovereignty over the Epicontinental Sea and the Continental Shelf where it declared that "the Argentina Epicontinental Sea[^25] and Continental Shelf are subject to the sovereign power of the Nation. Such Declaration did, however, specify that the "character" of the waters in question would remain unaffected for the purpose of "free navigation".[^26]

Panama in its 1946 Constitution proclaimed State ownership over both the territorial sea and the shelf. However, Decree 449 (1946) proclaimed "national jurisdiction for the purpose of fishing in general" over its territorial sea and the superjacent waters of the shelf. All fisheries, which it considered a "national product" within these limits, were subjected to the provisions of national legislation.[^27]

The Congress of Nicaragua on 1 May 1947, adopted a declaration extending its national sovereignty over the adjacent shelf, which on the Atlantic side is the most extensive in Central America.[^28]

Chile was the first State to establish a 200 nautical mile maritime zone.[^29] Through the Presidential Declaration of 23 June, 1947, it proclaimed "national sovereignty":

(a) over its shelf and the resources therein; and

(b) over the seas adjacent to its coasts whatever may be their depths, and within those limits necessary in order to reserve, protect, preserve, and exploit the natural resources of whatever nature found on, within, and below the said seas, placing within the control of the government especially all fisheries and whaling activities with the object of preventing the exploitation of natural riches of this kind to the detriment of the inhabitants of Chile and to prevent the spoiling or destruction of the said riches to the detriment of the country and the American continent.

Chile stated that its Declaration did not "disregard the similar legitimate rights of other States on a basis of reciprocity, [nor did it] affect the rights of free navigation on the high seas". The zone's breadth was fixed at 200 nautical miles without prejudice to future enlargements or modifications. This limit, it claimed, was consistent with the security zone adopted in the 1939 Declaration of Panama.[^30]

Under Presidential Decree No. 781 of 1947, Peru extended national sovereignty and jurisdiction to the submarine areas regardless of the depth of the superjacent waters, and to the adjacent sea to the extent necessary for the preservation, protection, conservation and exploitation of the natural wealth and resources therein. The zone's width was 200 nautical miles, within which the right of free navigation of all States would not suffer "any prejudice" in accordance with international law.

The differences between the Chilean and Peruvian legislation reflect the different national goals. No mention was made by Peru of the protection of whaling, which was Chile's main concern; instead it was concerned with the abundant offshore fisheries and their protection from foreign distant water fishing fleets. Unlike the Chilean Declaration, the Peruvian Decree made no provision for reciprocal fishing rights. Despite these differences, both claims were justified in terms of the precedents afforded by other States' claims, the Truman Proclamations in particular being commonly cited.[^31]

By Decree 116 (1948), Costa Rica proclaimed its "national sovereignty over the seas adjacent to the continental and insular coasts of the national territory, whatever their depth, and to the extent necessary to protect, conserve, and utilize the natural resources and wealth". This Decree also claimed:

> the protection and control of the State ... over all the sea included within the perimeter formed by the coasts and by a mathematical parallel, projected out to the sea at a distance of 200 maritime miles.

The Decree was revised by Legislative Decree 803 (1949), which changed the expression "national sovereignty" to "rights and interests of Costa Rica" and the word "control" applicable to the 200 mile zone was deleted.[^32]

The 1950 Constitution of El Salvador established a 200 nautical mile claim:

> The territory of the Republic within its present boundaries is irreducible. It includes the adjacent seas to a distance of 200 sea miles from the low-water line and the corresponding air space, subsoil and continental shelf.[^33]

However, within this zone freedom of navigation was not affected. The inclusion of the "corresponding air space" was a new variation not found in the previous claims. This constitutional provision with regard to fishing and marine hunting was implemented by means of Law No. 1961 (1955).[^34]

Similarly, Honduras passed Legislative Decree No. 25 (1951) which extended national sovereignty over the shelf and "the waters covering it", at whatever depth it might be found and whatever its extent might be; it claimed full, inalienable, and imprescriptible dominion over all the resources which were found in the area. This Decree was based on the Mexican and Argentinean claims as far as the "epicontinental sea" was concerned, and on those of Chile and Peru as far as the seaward limit of the submarine areas was concerned.[^35]

In effect, the Truman Proclamation, in attempting to establish fishing conservation zones in areas of the high seas contiguous to its coasts, made no reference to the shelf, but proceeded on a general theory of the right of a coastal State to protect its contiguous fisheries. By extending their sovereignty over the continental shelf and sea-bed, and over the superjacent waters, most of the above claims were beyond the Truman Proclamations.

These unilateral acts were supplemented and buttressed by a variety of bilateral declarations and agreements, sub-regional institutions, resolutions, and agreements such as the Permanent Commission of South Pacific States (Chile, Ecuador and Peru), declarations and resolutions of regional organizations and organs, and a multitude of statements by Latin American representatives in international conferences and United Nations organs.

#### (B) Regional Claims

It was not until the early 1950s that the first outlines of a regional position began to emerge. In the Declaration on the Maritime Zone signed in Santiago on August 18, 1952, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru proclaimed "... as a principle of their international maritime policy [exclusive] sovereignty and jurisdiction ..." over their coastal waters to a distance of 200 miles. The Santiago Declaration was reinforced by the establishment of a Permanent Commission, and in 1954, the three States signed a Supplementary Agreement by which, inter alia, they agreed to act jointly "in the legal defense of the principle of sovereignty over the 200 mile maritime zone."

Despite the fact that it represented the views of only three States, the Santiago Declaration has had a pervasive regional influence. Two aspects of it must be highlighted. The first is its underlying economic and social rationale, expressed in terms of economic development and the conservation and protection of natural resources.[^36] The second, and from the legal point of view more important aspect is that the Declaration is concerned with a maritime zone rather than the territorial sea.[^37]

The broader impact of the Santiago Declaration was immediate as it rapidly filtered through the inter-American system, drawing support from regional organs and conferences such as the Inter-American Council of Jurists, the Hispano-Luso-American Congress of International Law, and the Tenth Interamerican Conference.[^38]

Yet, despite these expressions of support, the South Pacific States remained isolated both regionally and internationally. The majority of Latin American States continued to adhere to the traditional concept of a territorial sea and, at the 1958 and 1960 Geneva Conference, adopted a middle of the road position with respect to the breadth of the territorial sea.[^39] But partly because of the confusion surrounding the practice of the South Pacific States and partly because of the spectacular nature of some of the incidents arising from the enforcement of the Santiago Declaration[^40], the 200 mile claim has been frequently misrepresented as the Latin America position. In fact, notwithstanding a major realignment of the claims by Latin American States, Latin America continued to exhibit a high degree of asymmetry with respect to the breadth and even the nature of the territorial sea.

Broadly speaking, Latin American legislation and practice prior to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea may be grouped under three main headings:

(1) claims to a territorial sea stricto sensu not exceeding 12 miles;

(2) claims to a 200 mile maritime zone of limited sovereignty; and

(3) claims to a 200 mile territorial sea stricto sensu.

The first group is formed by 12 States, geographically circumscribing the Caribbean, whose territorial sea claims, varying in breadth from 3 to 12 miles, correspond to the definition contained in Article 1 of the 1958 Geneva Convention.[^41] Five of these States (Dominican Republic, Haiti, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela), have ratified the Convention or acceded to it.

The third group consists of four States which have enacted legislation or promulgated decrees extending the territorial sea to 200 miles, subject only to the right of innocent passage. The Ecuadorian Decree No. 1542 of November 10, 1966; Panamanian Law No. 31 of February 2, 1967, and the Brazilian Decree-law No. 1.098 of March 25, 1970, expressly employ the term "territorial sea" and, in addition, explicitly or implicitly, reject any rights within the zone other than innocent passage.

In fact, as far as Brazil is concerned, the Brazilian Decree-Law No. 1.098 provides for derogation from the territorial sea strictu sensu. The Brazilian interpretation of the territorial sea encompassed the following regimes:

(1) an inner 100 mile exclusive fishing zone;

(2) an outer 100 mile fishing zone for Brazilian and foreign vessels;

(3) Brazilian sovereignty over the sea-bed and subsoil to a distance of 200 miles; and

(4) bilateral agreements for special types of fishing which had been concluded, so far, with the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, and The Netherlands.

The position of the fourth member of this group, Peru, was somewhat ambiguous. Supreme decree No. 781 of August 1, 1947, establishes (in paragraph 4) Peruvian sovereignty and jurisdiction over the adjacent sea to a distance of 200 miles but expressly grants freedom of navigation to vessels of all nations. On the one hand, this provision is incompatible with the traditional concept of the territorial sea as expressed in the 1958 Convention and, furthermore, both the preambular considerations in the decree and the omission of the term "territorial sea" would seem to suggest that the decree is aimed at the establishment of a maritime zone of limited sovereignty rather than a territorial sea.[^42] On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that the Peruvian maritime zone is a de facto territorial sea in which Peru exercises exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction subject only to innocent passage.

International agreements entered into by Peru subsequent to the 1947 Decree, posterior Peruvian legislation regulating such matters as fishing rights, navigation, and overflight, and particularly the manner in which Peruvian authorities have consistently enforced their sovereignty, point more readily to a territorial sea claim than to one of limited sovereignty.[^43] Thus, although Peru does not expressly claim a territorial sea of any breadth, the characteristics of its 200 mile maritime zone appear to be assimilable to a territorial sea strictu sensu.

In between these two groups, there had evolved a median position which was something of a composite of the two. Six States - Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Uruguay - claimed a 200 mile maritime zone of limited sovereignty within which the territorial sea strictu sensu does not exceed 12 miles. Although the relevant decrees or legislation wording suggested the exercise of sovereignty, this was in fact limited through the express or tacit acknowledgement of freedom of navigation and overflight within designated areas of the zone, characteristics which are incompatible with the traditional concept of the territorial sea.

For example, Argentinean Law No. 17.094 of 29 December, 1966, extends the "sovereignty of the nation" to a distance of 200 miles over the adjacent sea (Article 1) but expressly declares this to be without prejudice to freedom of navigation and overflight (Article 3). After several years of considerable uncertainty as to the precise nature and extent of the Argentinean territorial sea, the position was clarified by the Argentina-Chile Joint Declaration of July 22, 1971, in which the two States undertake to maintain the principle of freedom of navigation and overflight in their respective zones of maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction between the 12 mile and 200 mile limits.

Uruguayan Law No. 13.833 of December 29, 1969, establishes a "zone of territorial sea 200 nautical miles wide measured from the baseline" (Article 2). Article 3, however, specifies that the right of innocent passage prevails "through the territorial sea of Uruguay in a zone twelve miles wide" and that beyond the 12 miles zone the provisions of the law do not affect free navigation and overflight.[^44]

El Salvador is a classic example of a borderline case of qualification. The formal legislation indicates a 200 mile territorial sea, but the practical implementation of the law leaves considerable doubt whether a territorial sea claim stricto sensu can be entertained.

This overview of the Latin American territorial sea claims demonstrates quite clearly both the quantitative and qualitative asymmetry in contemporary Latin American practice. Quantitatively, these claims cover the entire spectrum of territorial limits from the classical 3 miles to the more extensive 200 miles; qualitatively, some of the claims correspond to the classical conception of the territorial sea as reflected in the Geneva Convention, others define this conception in more flexible terms, and yet others abandon the concept of the territorial sea altogether in favour of a system of maritime zones.

Despite the considerable substantive differences which continued to prevail in the individual legislation and practice of Latin American States, by 1970 a realignment of considerable geo-political importance had already taken place. A combination of groups 2 and 3, leaving aside the qualitative difference in the precise legal nature of the claims, resulted in the creation of a massive block extending from the Ecuador to Terra del Fuego with a 200 mile marginal sea. The once isolated South Pacific States found themselves progressively integrated into a system of continental rather than sub-regional proportions.[^45]

This pronounced trend towards continentalism had been encouraged and developed in a series of regional meetings, the first of which took place in Montevideo in May 1970 at the invitation of the Uruguayan Government and which was to be attended by the 10 Latin American States claiming a 200 mile marginal sea.[^46] This was followed three months later by a meeting in Lima of twenty Latin American States.[^47] Finally, in June 1972, there took place in Santo Domingo a specialized conference of Caribbean States. Each of these meetings has resulted in a declaration embodying certain basic principles or rights from which it is possible to extrapolate the embryonic elements of a common Latin American position.[^48]

Broadly speaking, the Declarations contain three basic principles or rights:

(1) the right of every nation to exercise control over its natural maritime resources;[^49]

(2) the right to delimit maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction in accordance with reasonable criteria having regard to each State's geographical, geological and biological characteristics;[^50] and

(3) the rights of every State to enact regulatory measures of an economic nature in areas of maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction without prejudice to freedom of navigation and overflight.[^51]

These principles were based on considerations deriving from the special economic and social requirements of less developed States and from the necessity to conserve the natural resources of the sea for the benefit of mankind as a whole.[^52]

It should be observed that neither the Montevideo nor Lima Declarations expressly refer to the "territorial sea", preferring instead the wording "maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction". The Santo Domingo Declaration, however, specifically addressed itself to the "territorial sea" as defined by the Geneva Convention and, furthermore, endorses a 12 mile limit.

With exception of those States claiming a territorial sea stricto sensu in excess of 12 miles (Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and Peru), the positions adopted by the Montevideo-Lima meetings and the Santo Domingo meeting were not incompatible.

### 3.3 Zones of Special Jurisdiction

Historically, States have from time to time established and enforced zones of special jurisdiction in areas that normally form part of the high seas. The creation of such zones in connection with fishing and the conservation of marine resources or with the enforcement of municipal legislation has normally been effected by means of unilateral acts, though it was frequently subject to subsequent bilateral agreements.

The 1958 Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone introduced, for the first time, the concept of special zones into positive international law. Article 24 of the Convention provided for a zone of the high seas contiguous to the territorial sea in which the State could exercise control over foreign vessels for the specific purposes of the prevention land punishment of infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitary regulations.

The 1958 and 1960 Geneva Conferences rejected Latin American proposals for the establishment of exclusive fishery zones but paid a heavy price in the failure to reach agreement on the breadth of the territorial sea.[^53] Since then an increasing number of Latin American States have established exclusive or semi-exclusive zones for the purposes of fishing or conservation. The Montevideo, Lima and Santo Domingo meetings re-affirmed the right of coastal States to explore, conserve and exploit the natural resources of the sea adjacent to their coasts as a basic principle.

A concerted effort, therefore, would once more appear to be underway among the Latin American States with respect to the development of a new formula for zones of special jurisdiction adjacent to the territorial sea.

In enunciating the basic principles of the law of the sea, the Montevideo and Lima Declarations attached no specific labels to the maritime zone over which coastal States should exercise their sovereignty and jurisdiction. By contrast, the Santo Domingo Declaration dealt specifically with precise areas of the sea - the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas - including an area described as the "patrimonial sea". The patrimonial sea was "a zone adjacent to the territorial sea" in which the coastal State would exercise "sovereign rights" over the living and mineral resources found therein, whether they were in the waters, sea-bed or subsoil. The breadth of this zone would be determined by agreement, preferably multilateral, among States, but in any event the combined breadth of the territorial and patrimonial seas would not exceed 200 miles. The zone would not interfere with freedom of navigation and overflight and the laying of pipelines and cables except insofar as these activities might conflict with the exercise of the coastal State's patrimonial rights (Article 5). The principal purpose of the zone was economic, although the coastal State would also have a duty to promote and the right to regulate scientific research and to adopt anti-pollution measures (Article 2).

The formulation of the patrimonial sea concept in the Santo Domingo Declaration bears a close resemblance to a proposal advanced by Edmundo Vargas in his Preliminary Report on the Territorial Sea and Patrimonial Sea presented to the Inter-American Juridical Committee.

The patrimonial sea was conceived as a zone distinct from but adjacent to the territorial sea in which the coastal State would exercise sovereign rights but not sovereignty. The distinction is important. In other words, the coastal State would possess a usufruct over the "patrimonial" area which would permit it to exploit the economic potential of the zone directly or through the granting of concessions and licenses. To some extent, a system of this type was already in de facto operational in Brazil and Uruguay and had been for some time in the 1952 Santiago Maritime zone.

Historically, the lineage of the patrimonial sea may be traced to two specifically Latin American concepts - the epicontinental sea and the complementary sea - neither of which achieved a generalized degree of acceptance.[^54] In addition, special zones for a variety of purposes have from time to time been established in the Americas. For example, the 1939 Declaration of Panama established a wide "collective security" zone extending up to 300 miles on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The Treaty of Tlatelolco provided for a nuclear-free zone and the Canadian Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act created a 100 mile anti-pollution zone.[^55]

Thus, the patrimonial sea can hardly be described as a new concept but rather as a case of old wine in new bottles. The departure from the past, however, lies in the potential degree of support for the concept in Latin America and elsewhere. It is significant that the proposal emerged from the Santo Domingo group of Caribbean States and not, as might have been expected, from the Montevideo group of 200 mile States. Outside Latin America, the concept had already been substantially endorsed by a group of African States.

In fact, by 1972 the tide was running strongly towards assertion of claims over a 200 mile zone. Latin American countries had led the way and the Caribbean States gave solid support to the "patrimonial sea" concept in their Declaration of Santo Domingo. Meanwhile, lawyers in African States were becoming involved, and it was they who crystallized the idea of an "economic zone" and gave it a name.

The concept, which was undoubtedly attractive to many States from the economic point of view, was accepted at the African States Regional Seminar on the Law of the Sea held at Younde, Cameroon, in June 1972.[^56] The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council of Ministers endorsed the concept in 1973.

Reference must be made to the Resolution of the Inter-American Juridical Committee dated 9 February, 1973. Having studied the topic of its work programme, entitled Law of the Sea, since 1971, the Committee in its Resolution recommended "principles and standards" which "represent the common elements of the positions of the American States". The Resolution declared that:

> the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a coastal state extends ... up to a maximum distance of 200 nautical miles as well as to the airspace above and the bed and subsoil of that sea.

Within this zone, the coastal State had inter alia the "power" to regulate the exploration and exploitation of the living and non-living resources therein; to promulgate environmental measures; and to promote scientific research activities.

Provision was also made to safeguard the freedoms of movement, overflight, and communication subject to the coastal powers mentioned above. Of particular interest is the Resolution's proposal that enabled landlocked States to exploit the zone's living resources by granting them "preferential rights in relation to third States ...". Previous Latin American declarations had failed to refer to the rights of landlocked States.

This Resolution can be considered as an attempt to consolidate the common elements found in the various Latin American claims.[^57]

### 3.4 The Continental Shelf

The third regime which completes the unity of zones within national jurisdiction is the continental shelf. The continental shelf is known, geologically, as those submarine areas which extend from the shore to the point at which there is a marked fall-off (the continental slope) to the ocean floor of the deep sea-bed.

The term "continental shelf" apparently was first used in a geological and geographical context in the late nineteenth century but it only acquired legal significance after its use in the Truman Proclamation and in other similar decrees issued shortly thereafter by various States. The Proclamation did not define the "continental shelf", but in an accompanying press release it was generally considered - although not yet by the law - to be the subsoil and sea-bed of the submarine areas contiguous to the coasts of the United States and covered by no more than 100 fathoms (600 feet or 200 meters) of water.

The Latin American preoccupation with the legal regime of the continental shelf may be traced to the bilateral agreement between Venezuela and the United Kingdom in 1942, which regulated the respective rights of the parties over the submarine area of the Gulf of Paria.[^58] But it was the Truman Declaration of 1945 which drew attention to the economic potential of the shelf and provided the impetus for a rapid succession of shelf claims by Latin American States.

The geographic and geological characteristics of the Latin American continent have played an important role in determining the continental shelf policies of Latin American States. The Pacific coast of Latin America drops abruptly into the ocean, depriving countries with long coastlines, such as Chile and Peru, of all but a very narrow shelf, while the Atlantic and Caribbean coast countries are endowed with a broad shelf. Because of the economic benefits to be derived from the resources of the shelf, the nature and scope of the sovereign rights of coastal States over the shelf area is of considerable practical importance to Latin America.

From the Latin America perspective, the principal shelf issues were the definition of the outer limit of the continental shelf, the delimitation of the shelf between adjacent or opposing States, the definition of natural resources of the shelf, and finally the legal regime for the superjacent waters. These were all issues over which Latin American States had long been at odds with the major maritime powers.

Article 1 of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf was inadequate for the purpose of drawing a line between national and international jurisdiction since the criteria of depth and/or exploitability under contemporary technological conditions resulted in a constantly expanding outer limit.[^59]

Only a small number of Latin American States ratified the Convention on the continental Shelf or acceded to it.[^60] The majority of States remained unfettered by the Convention but in practice did not depart excessively from its provisions concerning the outer limit of the shelf. Indeed, given the unlimited flexibility offered by the exploitability criterion, there is little reason to do so. Only three States have explicitly adopted a more restrictive or more expansive position than the Convention. Ecuador restricted itself to the limit of the 200 meter isobath, whereas both Costa Rica and Guyana asserted unlimited claims over the shelf. For the remainder, the controlling principle appears to be that as stated in the Montevideo Declaration, namely:

> the right to explore, conserve and exploit the natural resources of their respective continental shelf out to where the depth of the superjacent waters admit of exploitation.

(Basic Principle 4).

The Santo Domingo Declaration, however, appears to presage an attempt to broaden both the scope and the outer limit of the shelf. The relevant provisions of the Declaration dealing with the shelf provide, firstly, that the shelf "includes the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast" and, secondly, recognize the desirability of defining more precise limits "taking into account the outer limit of the continental rise." The former provision appears to be an attempt to satisfy selfless or disadvantaged States such as Chile, whereas the latter would have the effect of extending the outer limit of the shelf beyond even the continental slope to the continental rise which is frequently at a depth of between 3,500 and 5,500 meters.[^61] The Santo Domingo Declaration further deals with the problem of the area of the shelf which underlies the patrimonial sea and envisages that this part of the shelf would be regulated by the patrimonial sea regime as distinct from a continental shelf regime to be established for the area beyond.

The Latin American declarations referred above were consistent with the overall objectives of Latin American policies which may be summed up as exercising the maximum economic jurisdiction over marine resources. In attempting to push back the outer limit of the shelf as far as possible, the Latin American States were pursuing this objective.

### 3.5 Brazil and Its Position

Brazil occupies almost one half of the entire South American continent and is the fourth largest country in the world in terms of non-interrupted land surface.[^62] For every 1.3 kilometers of land frontier, there is 1 kilometer of sea coast. The coastline has a length of 9,200 kilometers[^63] divided into 5 regions going from north to south.[^64]

The navigability of the coastal waters facilitated the settlement of the coastal regions. Beginning in the sixteenth century settlements were established on the coast but rarely, if ever, inland. Brazilian territory was overwhelmed by the sea and the opening up of the interior - a complex and not always successful process of penetration - has continued to the present time.[^65]

Because of the high incidence of coastal settlement, which took advantage of the economic, environmental and sociological conditions provided by the sea, Brazil was quite correctly designated a peripheral country.

An understanding of the Brazilian nation is possible only if the Atlantic Ocean is taken into account. The Atlantic is the "great designer of the coastline of the country; the Brazilian islands are located in it; and most of the rivers of the country flow into it.[^66] It may be said that Brazil's present characteristics and unity have been achieved due to the advantages provided by the sea as a natural waterway.

> For a long time the country was a kind of archipelago in which a few islands, organized around the main centres of population and production, existed in total isolation from one another because of the immense and impenetrable deserts, forests and other geographical obstacles. The voyage from Rio de Janeiro to Bahia, Pernambuco, or the far north was only possible by sea ... although today it might seem incredible, the voyage to the Mato Grosso could only be done up the River Plate via Buenos Aires.[^67]

This explains why "the centres of population, overwhelmed by the sea, communicated with one another by sea than by land until only a few years ago."[^68]

It was realized gradually that the sea was not only a vital element for the transportation of persons and goods, but was also a source of natural wealth. The concept of the adjacent sea as an integral element of the Brazilian patrimony, and its role with regard to the basic needs of the country, has been emphasized as one of the values prevailing in the current legislation. This concept has acquired special significance in the public eye due to such things as lobster fishing by foreign vessels on the Brazilian continental shelf; trawling by these vessels, which destroys both lobsters and shrimps; exploration of mineral nodules lying on the shelf; the depletion of fish stocks; and the employment of sophisticated techniques by foreign vessels, which create unfair competition for the poor and rudimentary vessels of the coastal population.

#### 3.5.1 The Breadth of the Brazilian Territorial Sea in Historical Perspective

The examination of the rules on the delimitation of adjacent maritime areas enacted in Brazilian laws reveals 5 successive periods since the political independence of the country in 1822.

The earliest period corresponds to the Portuguese legislation in force at the time of the independence of Brazil. This is the period of the cannon-shot rule, enacted in Lisbon by means of a decree-law of March 4, 1805.[^69] Thus, Brazil acceded to independence with a rule different from that in force in other American countries which had gained independence from Spain or England and for whom the rule of 6 or 3 nautical miles prevailed, at least since independence.

The cannon-shot rule was mentioned in Instruction No. 92 of July 31, 1850, addressed by the Brazilian Ministry of War to the Presidents of the maritime provinces. In 1876, when the rule was still in force, a law was enacted which authorized the captains of vessels or customs police to visit and arrest those ships suspected of smuggling, up to a distance of 12 miles from the coast.[^70] This was the same year in which Great Britain abrogated the Hovering Acts, enacted in the early eighteenth century.[^71]

The second period corresponds to the 3 mile rule, which was first provided for by Instruction No. 43 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of August 25, 1914. The rule was first enacted for the purposes of neutrality in World War I. It remained in force, however, for over 36 years, although not always strictly interpreted. The instructions given to the Brazilian delegation to the 1930 Hague Conference for the Codification of International Law advocated the enlargement of the territorial sea so that the needs of administrative law would coincide with the provisions of international law, thereby ensuring that the limits of the jurisdiction of the State over its sea and territories be identical "whether it is a case of international relations or of the application of administrative regulations."

As a result of these instructions, the delegation of Brazil moved in favour of a 6 mile territorial sea and against the institution of a contiguous zone. Notwithstanding this position, 2 years later the government established a contiguous zone of 12 miles measured from the coast, which also applied to fishing.[^72] In 1941, the Second Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs established a 12 mile security zone. This was strongly supported by Brazil.

When World War II came to an end and the process of revision of the rules of the law of the sea started, the Government of Brazil declared that its continental shelf was an integral part of the national territory. This was provided for in Decree No. 26.840 of 8 November 1950, which followed similar declarations by the United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Peru. In accordance with this decree, the incorporation of the shelf was not intended to imply an enlargement of the territorial sea, which continued to be governed by the 3 mile formula.

The 3 mile rule was gradually undermined by principles which Brazilian lawyers supported in international meetings. The Principles of Mexico on the legal regime of the sea, approved in 1956 by the Inter-American Council of Jurists[^73], not only declared that 3 miles were insufficient as the limit of the territorial sea and that it was no longer a general rule of international law, but also supported the right of each State to fix the breadth of its territorial sea within reasonable limits.[^74] In the Geneva Conferences on the Law of the Sea, the joint United States-Canadian proposal was supported. Finally, the Inter-American Juridical Committee[^75] recommended in 1965 that every American State had the right to fix the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit of 12 nautical miles measured from the applicable baseline.

A year later with the enactment of Decree-Law No. 44 of 18 November 1966, the period of a 6 mile territorial sea was inaugurated. This decree also established an additional contiguous zone of 6 miles, for the purposes of customs, fiscal, sanitary and immigration matters, but over which Brazil had "the same rights of fishing and exploration of the living resources of the sea" enjoyed in the territorial sea.

In 1968, two years after the Brazilian Legislature had established a 6 mile territorial sea and a contiguous zone of 6 additional miles, the Executive introduced in Congress the 4 Geneva Conventions. The draft legislative-decree then prepared authorized the President of the Republic to order the accession of the government to those conventions, but with the following reservation: "The accession to the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone may only be ordered after a law will have extended the territorial sea of Brazil to 12 miles, eliminating the contiguous zone." As a matter of fact, this limit was adopted shortly thereafter, by means of Decree-Law No. 553 of 25 April 1969, which enlarged the territorial sea to a belt of 12 nautical miles breadth, measured from the low-water line.

Notwithstanding this authorization, the Government of Brazil, taking into account the opinion of congressmen, officials and others decided not to accede to the Geneva Conventions and adopted the 200-mile territorial sea. The Decree-Law No. 1.098 of 25 March 1970, approved by Congress by means of Legislative Decree No. 31 of 27 May 1970, proclaimed a 200-mile territorial sea. This distance had been used three decades earlier by the Declaration of Panama with regard to hemispheric security, and 20 years earlier by the proclamations of Chile and Peru. Argentina, in 1967, and Uruguay, in 1969, had also adopted this limit.

One of the criteria of Decree-Law No. 1.098 of 25 March 1970 reiterates section A-2 of Resolution XIII of the Third Meeting of the Inter-American Council of Jurists, held in Mexico in 1956, which declares that:

> Each State is competent to establish its territorial waters within reasonable limits, taking into account geographical, geological and biological factors, as well as the economic needs of its population and its security and defense.

Another criterion further states that:

> the special interest of the coastal State in the preservation of the productivity of the living resources of the maritime areas adjacent to its coast is recognized by international law.

The concern for productivity was a basic consideration in the decision which established a 200 mile territorial sea.

The need to protect the natural resources of the adjacent sea - a fact which was emphasized constantly - came to be of great importance as a result of the increasing exploitation of these resources by foreign vessels and the discrepancy existing between their technology and the elementary technology of Brazilian vessels. The case of the numerous factory ships, which fished 20 miles offshore, depleting the large stocks of the South Atlantic, is well known.

Another element which influenced the acceptance of the 200 mile policy was the need to avoid a situation of isolating Brazil from its neighbours of the South Atlantic, which would have made it difficult to negotiate certain relevant problems, such as those of fishing on a reciprocal basis. Strengthening the link of regional solidarity with other Latin American countries was considered to be of utmost importance. In order to avoid problems, it was argued that there should be no differences with the breadth fixed by Uruguay and Argentina "with the former, in fixing the lateral maritime limit, and with the latter in ratifying the agreement on fisheries which had been provisionally signed at the time that Argentina enlarged its territorial sea."[^76]

The decision to adopt a 200 mile territorial sea was also influenced by strategic considerations, naturally related to the enlargement of the territorial ambit needed for the exercise of national security. From this point of view, the fact that both the Declaration of Panama of 1939 and the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance established a security zone, which to a certain extent corresponds to a 200 mile breadth, was duly taken into account.

Lastly, the importance of protecting the continental shelf and its natural resources was also taken into consideration.

In accordance with Decree-Law No. 1.098, national sovereignty would be exercised over the territorial sea, the sea-bed and subsoil thereof and the airspace above it. Ships of all nations could enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.

Brazil, after having followed an approach which could generally be identified with a territorialist policy, signed and later, on 22 December 1988 ratified the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, with the declaration of compatibility of its domestic regime with the provisions of the Convention. At the same time, the Brazilian Constitution adopted on 5 October 1988 refers both to the exclusive economic zone and the territorial sea in its Article 20 as public domain of the Union.

The Brazilian position was only clarified with regard to the breadth of the territorial sea with the adoption on 4 January 1993 of Law No. 8.617, which establishes a territorial sea of 12 miles.

### 3.6 The Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea

In 1958, the United Nations was able to codify in four Conventions (UNCLOS I) many rules governing the territorial sea and the high seas, and added new rules relating to the oil-rich continental shelf, but the breadth of the territorial sea under the control of coastal States remained undefined. Even in the 1960 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS II) this issue could not be solved. However, those new treaties soon proved obsolete due to the rapid increase in the use of the ocean and in the exploitation of its resources.

In the late 1960's the world was faced with a nightmare of conflicts over maritime rights among the big powers, between them and smaller powers, and among small powers themselves. Fishing ceased to be a local enterprise, as large factory ships and vast fleets of smaller ships started roaming the oceans, exhausting the resources of one area after another. Mammoth oil tankers began carrying tremendous quantities of oil across the oceans and several bad incidents made the people of the world conscious of the dangers of oil pollution of their beaches and fishing grounds. The marine environment could no longer cope with the assault from many directions: dumping of wastes from land, oil pollution from ships and additional oil pollution from drilling in the continental shelf. Technology developed to the point that even resources on the deep sea-bed some 5.000 meters below the surface of the sea, became accessible, and a new regime became necessary for governing the exploitation of billions of tons of "manganese nodules", potato-sized lumps of several metals (not only manganese but also copper, nickel and cobalt), eagerly sought by metal-hungry industries.[^77]

The only possible solution to all these conflicts was the establishment of a new international legal regime, a code of international law for the oceans. The United Nations arranged, therefore, for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea[^78], which over a period of 8 years, from 1974 to 1982, hammered away at a convention on the subject, a complex document containing provisions on fifteen major topics. The area covered is tremendous, more than 70 percent of the surface of the earth. In the final division of spoils, the coastal States were able to obtain jurisdiction over the resources of one-third of the ocean area, and new rules, more precise than in the past, were developed to control navigation, fishing and exploitation of other resources of the sea, and to protect the marine environment from pollution.

It is noteworthy to refer at this stage that the mammoth task of elaborating this new regime began in 1967, when the concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind was first discussed by the UN General Assembly in the context of the question of preservation of the sea-bed and ocean floor exclusively for peaceful purposes. Most part of the Maltese Ambassador Arvid Pardo's famous speech to the First Committee of the UN General Assembly on 1st November 1967 consisted of warnings of how uncontrolled activities on the sea-bed, whether mining or military, could be threatening the fragile management systems which the world community had devised.

UNCLOS III, reputed to be the longest, largest and most expensive international conference in the history of mankind, held an organization session in New York in December 1973 and its first substantive session in Caracas in June 1974. There were over 2.000 delegates representing some 143 jurisdictional entities, many of them newly independent States not even present at UNCLOS II, facing an agenda of over a hundred items.[^79]

The Conference's work was further complicated by its intricate politics. Clearly, in relation to its agenda, no two States were identical. Geography and national interests cut across the usual regional groupings found at other UN meetings. Thus the Conference's deliberation were influenced by two contradicting cleavages. The first, based on economic and political factors, saw the developed States facing the alliance of developing States known as the "Group of 77". The second, based on geographical and geological factors, cut across most ideological ties and brought together States with similar geophysical characteristics. The land-locked States, for example, grouped together not on any ideological basis but as a result of their geographical position. To undertake the Conference's task three committees were set up: Committee I to deal with the common heritage of mankind and the proposed international regime; Committee II to deal with the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, straits used for international navigation, the shelf, the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, fishing and navigational rights, the rights of land-locked States, geographically disadvantaged States and archipelagoes, enclosed seas, and islands; Committee III to deal with scientific research and environmental issues.[^80]

Since the Committees were set up, consensus was then adopted as the principal means by which decisions were to be taken. Because of the large number of participants and sensitive issues involved, working groups revealed themselves being more efficient than plenary meetings. Indeed, much of the elaboration process took place in smaller or more informal meetings, but always on an ad referendum basis to larger and/or more formal bodies.

The working or negotiating groups were generally established on the basis of interest in a particular issue. Instead of coalescing within traditional regional or political alignments, they grouped themselves to face specific issues and to protect clearly identifiable interests. "For example, coastal States wanted a legal regime that would allow them to manage and conserve the biological and mineral resources within their national jurisdiction; archipelagic States wanted to obtain recognition for the new regime of archipelagic waters; land-locked States were seeking general rules of international law that would grant them transit to and from the sea and rights of access to the living resources of their neighbouring States; some industrialized nations wanted to have guaranteed access to the sea-bed mineral resources beyond national jurisdiction within a predictable legal framework; countries that produced the same minerals in their territories wanted assurances that the sea-bed production of these minerals would not undermine their economies or result in a de facto monopoly; developing countries wanted to be more than silent witnesses to the acquisition of new knowledge of the oceans so that marine science and technology could be put at the service of all and not only of a limited number of very wealthy countries; States bordering straits wanted to ensure that free passage would not result in damage to their marine environment or threats to their national security; practically all nations wanted to preserve the freedoms of navigation, commerce and communication; and finally, mankind as a whole needed to ensure that a new legal regime would safeguard the marine environment against depredation or irrational use of non-renewable resources, the discharge or dumping of noxious substances into the oceans or the so-called scientific tests that could affect the delicate balance of marine life. These are only a few of the multitude of particular interest which needed consideration at the Conference."[^81]

The final meetings of the Conference were held in Montego Bay, Jamaica, from 6 December to 10 December 1982. The Convention was opened for signature in Jamaica on 10 December. On that first day, signatures from 119 delegations comprising 117 States were appended to the Convention. Never before has such overwhelming support been demonstrated so concretely on the first day that a treaty has been open for signature.

#### 3.6.1 The Text Itself: Some Highlights

The Convention itself establishes a comprehensive framework for the regulation of all ocean space. It is divided into 17 parts and 9 annexes and contains provisions governing, inter alia, the limits of national jurisdiction over ocean space, access to the seas, navigation, protection and preservation of the marine environment, exploitation of living resources and conservation, scientific research, sea-bed mining and other exploitation of non-living resources and the settlement of disputes. In addition, it establishes new international bodies to carry out functions for the realization of specific objectives.[^82]

The first six parts of the Convention deal generally with the question of areas of national jurisdiction. The General Assembly Declaration of Principles (Resolution 2749 (XXV)) established that the Common Heritage of Mankind comprises the area of sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, "the precise limits of which are yet to be determined". It is the Convention which sets out the guidelines for the determination of those limits.[^83]

The Convention allows for the establishment of a territorial sea of up to 12 nautical miles in breadth, providing various methods for determining baselines and for distinguishing between territorial waters and internal waters. The traditional right of innocent passage through territorial waters is recognized, and some specificity as to what kinds of activities contravene innocence of passage is included. In the case of the waters of States bordering straits, the concept of transit passage is introduced, which draws more from the concept of necessity than does innocent passage and is somewhat more liberal. The concept of archipelagic waters is introduced for the case of archipelagoes, whereby sovereignty may be recognized over the waters within an island group and the conditions and modalities for establishment of baselines in such cases are specified. Archipelagic sea-lanes passage is also provided.[^84]

Beyond territorial waters, the Convention allows the creation of an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 nautical miles. Traditionally, all areas beyond territorial waters comprised the high seas. In order for coastal States to gain economic benefit from areas further off their shores, it was necessary for them to extend their territorial waters, thus eliminating all freedoms of the high seas in the annexed areas. This imposed upon the interest of other maritime States, which insisted that customary law permitted a territorial sea of only 3 miles breadth and that anything beyond that entailed abridgement of their freedoms. This disagreement was one of the major issues facing the Conference when it began its work.[^85]

The provisions pertaining to the exclusive economic zone are the manifestation of one of the first "mini-packages" of delicately balanced compromises to emerge from the negotiations. The ubiquitous concept of the balance of rights and duties can be most clearly illustrated in this context. The Convention allows the coastal State certain rights in the exclusive economic zone for the purpose of economic advantage, notably rights over fishing and exploitation of non-living resources, as well as concomitant limited jurisdiction in order to realize those rights. At the same time, however, neighbouring land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States must be allowed access to those resources of the zone that the coastal State does not exploit, and, further, the traditional freedoms of the high seas are to be maintained in this area. The recognition of the rights of others in the zone is, however, without prejudice to the rights of the coastal State. In order to safeguard the protection of so many different interests in the zone, all States must undertake to respect and accommodate the rights and legitimate uses of other States in the zone. The Convention lays a broad framework for the peaceful accomplishment of this purpose.[^86]

Beyond the limits of the exclusive economic zone, the determination of which provisions of the Convention are applicable to a given activity depends upon the site of the activity involved. Activities on the surface and in the water column are governed by the provisions on the high seas. These generally follow customary international law allowing the freedoms of the high seas, but augment the law in several important respects, notably with regard to pollution and safety regulations, scientific research, conservation, and prevention of illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances. Activities on the sea-bed and in the subsoil of the continental shelf may fall within the national jurisdiction of the coastal State if the formation of the continental shelf meets specified criteria. The Convention provides for the establishment of a Commission of experts to advise on the delineation of the outer edge of the continental margin, that is, the limit of national jurisdiction over the continental shelf.[^87]

Having provided the guidelines for the determination of the limits of national jurisdiction, the Convention then sets out the principles and regulations governing the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond those limits, the common heritage of mankind. The formulation of these provisions was especially difficult since it wholly represents the progressive development of law and was therefore unaided by the guidance of precedent. The very delicate balance of compromises which emerged represented another "mini-package" within the package, and cannot be divorced from the provisions of resolutions I and II.[^88]

The body empowered to administer the common heritage of mankind and to regulate its exploration and exploitation will be the International Sea-Bed Authority, an international organization open to memberships by all States as well as international organizations and other entities meeting specified criteria (parties to the Convention are ipso facto members of the Authority, Article 156). The Authority will have an Assembly, which will be the supreme body and will reflect the balance between the sovereign equality of all States and a Council with limited representation. The Council will have primary responsibility over sea-bed mining activities and will be advised by specialized commissions.[^89]

It is not the structure but the functions of the International Sea-Bed Authority which make it a forerunner in the development of the law of international organizations. Not only is it entrusted with the power to directly regulate purely commercial activities, but it is also empowered to engage in sea-bed mining in its own right, through its commercial arm, the Enterprise. This is the essence of the "parallel system", a concept arrived at as a compromise in 1976 after arduous negotiations. The conditions and modalities for financing the Enterprise and for ensuring that it is technologically equipped to carry out activities form an integral part of the package. The Convention also delineates specific provisions regarding how the Authority must go about selecting among applicants for sea-bed mining and on what basis, how much production from the resources of the Area will be allowed in a specific period, and other technical aspects of application, authorization and the conduct of sea-bed activities.[^90]

In addition to the enunciation of regimes on a special basis, the Convention deals with certain other matters of global concern. Among these are ecological and environmental issues. The general principles and policies governing prevention, reduction and control of pollution throughout the marine environment are established, as are the specific rights and duties of States concerned for the realization of their environmental and ecological goals. The allocation of the rights and the burden of the duties would vary depending upon the location and/or the type of pollution involved, and specific safeguard and enforcement provisions are included. The Convention is intended to be compatible with existing treaties on this question and to provide a broad framework for the conclusion of future more specific agreements.[^91]

The Convention also includes provisions intended to foster the development and facilitate the transfer of all kinds of marine technology and to encourage the conduct of marine scientific research. The inclusion of such provisions was dependent upon the establishment of adequate safeguards for the holder of rights concerned.[^92]

The Convention obliges parties to settle their disputes peacefully and provides a selection of methods for doing so in the event that they are otherwise unable to reach agreement even with third party intervention. The system under the Convention is a compulsory and binding one in that, with limited exceptions, a party has no choice but to submit to a settlement procedure if requested to do so by the other disputant, and is bound to abide by the findings of the body to which the dispute is submitted. States may make a prior determination of which fora they would be amenable to, and for this purpose the Convention allows a choice from among the International Court of Justice, arbitration or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, a new and autonomous specialized tribunal established by the Convention. In certain cases where the Convention does not call for a binding method of settlement, the parties are enjoined to submit their dispute to conciliation.[^93]

The creation of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea marks an advance in the evolution of the law of international institutions of its kind not only because of the structural autonomy of the Sea-Bed Disputes Chamber and the fact that the Chamber has exclusive jurisdiction over sea-bed matters, but also because private and juridical persons will have direct access to the Chamber on an equal footing with States, since these persons will be the ones directly involved in the activities over which the disputes may arise.[^94]

## 4. The Convention and the Practice of Latin American States

Since the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982, Latin American countries have been expressing a keen interest in its provisions and have been following closely the debate on key issues of interpretation and implementation of this body of law. Such interest can be observed at both the governmental and private levels, with the Convention being regarded generally as a major contribution to the codification and development of international law in the field. As a result of this process, new legislation is being enacted in a number of countries while at the same time a genuine effort is taking place to adapt domestic rules to the Convention provisions.

### 4.1 Territorial Sea

The breadth of the territorial sea has been one of the major issues in Latin American law and practice relating to the law of the sea. Ever since the enactment of the 1947 Chilean Proclamation on a national maritime zone of 200 miles and the ensuing Santiago Declaration of 1952, the problem has been repeatedly discussed both domestically and at various international fora. It should be kept in mind, however, that the purpose of such early enactments as the Chilean Proclamation was not directly related to the territorial sea but to the question of control over the exploitation of ocean resources - particularly living resources - an approach which in fact led later to the concept and regime of the exclusive economic zone. In this sense, the issue of the breadth of the "territorial sea" as used in the region became gradually clarified.

The laws of Chile (1986)[^95], Colombia (1978)[^96], Costa Rica (1975)[^97], Cuba (1977)[^98], Guatemala (1976)[^99], Haiti (1977)[^100], Honduras (1980)[^101], Mexico (1986)[^102] and Venezuela (1978)[^103], have been inspired by the 12 mile territorial sea and 200 mile exclusive economic zone approach of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. In the case of Chile, the amendments incorporated in the Civil Code to this effect made perfectly clear that it had never been a part of the "territorialist" group as some interpretations of the 1947 Proclamation has assumed.

There are, in addition, some countries which at some point adopted 200 mile territorial sea policies or their equivalent, but which have later changed or clarified their legislation or have otherwise abandoned such claims in practice. Argentina had claimed since 1966 sovereignty over the 200 mile area[^104] and had followed an inconsistent practice in this regard, but gradually it came to accept the distinction between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone. This position came to be entirely consolidated in the 1991 Law on Maritime Areas.[^105]

Brazil, after having followed an approach which could generally be identified with a territorialist policy, signed and later ratified the 1982 Convention, with the declaration of compatibility of its domestic regime with the provisions of the Convention.[^106] At the same time, the 1988 Brazilian Constitution refers both to the exclusive economic zone and the territorial sea.[^107] The Brazilian position seems now to be clarified with the adoption on 4 January 1993 of Law No. 8.617, which establishes a territorial sea of 12 miles.[^108]

Somewhat similar situations to that of Brazil can be found in the cases of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay. Successive Salvadorean Constitutions have referred to the sovereignty over adjacent maritime areas, generally following a territorialist approach, albeit admitting the distinction between the territorial sea and other areas. Since the signature of the Convention, however, the distinction between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone has become paramount and the traditional territorialist approach has been de-emphasized in practice.[^109] Also Nicaragua had followed since 1979, the policy of claiming sovereignty over the 200 mile adjacent maritime areas and airspace, allowing for "innocent passage" in the form and conditions as determined by its laws and treaties.[^110] However, the signing of the Convention and the political developments that have taken place in that country have greatly mitigated the territorialist approach in practice. Panama's claim to a 200 mile territorial sea[^111] can no longer be considered as a main element of its policy in the law of the sea, particularly after it signed the Convention. Although no formal legislative changes have been introduced, in practice this claim is not asserted. Uruguay's claim to a 200 mile territorial sea[^112] always made the distinction between the innocent passage regime applicable in the first 12 miles and the freedom of navigation and overflight applicable beyond it. It also declared upon signing the Convention that the provisions on the territorial sea and exclusive economic zone were compatible with its domestic legislation.[^113] Furthermore, Uruguay ratified the Convention in December 1992.

It follows from the above that in fact only Ecuador and Peru kept with their long-standing policy of claiming a 200 mile territorial sea as far as the Latin American region is concerned. Ecuador's Civil Code is very explicit on this claim.[^114] In spite of occasional signs of flexibility on the part of the Ecuadorian Government, the policy has been pursued rather vigorously and it is still regarded as a major factor of incompatibility for acceding to the 1982 Convention. Peru's substantive policy is rather similar, but two important differences should be noted: the first is that Peru has never labelled its claim as one relating to the "territorial sea", but rather the expression "jurisdictional waters" is used, which opens the way for potential flexibility in terms of interpretation.[^115] It should be noted that a genuine effort aimed at the re-definition of this policy has been undertaken by a key Peruvian diplomat.[^116]

### 4.2 Contiguous Zone

Contiguous zones have long been established in the laws of Latin American countries, which generally had adopted as their outer limit 12 miles from the baselines for the territorial sea, with the notable exception of Venezuela, which had claimed a 15 mile contiguous zone in 1956.[^117] Four countries in Latin America enacted 24 mile contiguous zones on the basis of legislation adopted while the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was in progress, or on the basis of claims made since the conclusion of the 1982 Convention.[^118]

States have followed generally the Convention provisions on the contiguous zone. Security zones or jurisdiction to the effect of preventing or punishing the infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitary laws have not been claimed by countries in the region, with the exception of Haiti.[^119] When Chile amended the Civil Code in 1986 to include, among other maritime areas, a 24 mile contiguous zone, the thought of claiming jurisdiction in terms of security was specifically discussed but turned down precisely because of its incompatibility with the Convention.[^120]

The issue of security, however, has been closely related to the policy of the 200 mile territorial sea mentioned above, or to interpretations of the exclusive economic zone which have tended to restrict the freedom of navigation of foreign warships. Some claims to control the overflying of maritime areas beyond the territorial sea are also related to security considerations. In some situations of armed confrontation claims to maritime security areas were made unilaterally, an example being the 150 mile "exclusion zone" enacted by the United Kingdom around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands in the aftermath of its conflict with Argentina. The zone was removed after the normalization of relations between the two countries.

### 4.3 Exclusive Economic Zone

As discussed earlier in Chapter 3, the concept of the exclusive economic zone found its origins in the Latin American and Caribbean law and practice of the 1940s and subsequent decades. Therefore, it is not surprising that an important number of countries in the region has enacted legislation relating to the exclusive economic zone as it emerged from the negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The following Latin American countries have formally incorporated the exclusive economic zone concept in their general or specific legislation: Argentina (1992), Belize (1992), Brazil (1993), Chile (1986), Colombia (1978), Costa Rica (1975), Guatemala (1976), Honduras (1980), Mexico (1986), Suriname (1978) and Venezuela (1978).

The substantive aspects of Latin American claims to an exclusive economic zone reveal an important distinction which has to be kept in mind. On the one hand, there is full consistency with the general concept of the exclusive economic zone as defined in the 1982 Convention or some of its drafts. But, on the other hand, there are important differences as to the specific regimes that govern each of the basic components of the zone.[^121]

The claims to sovereign rights for the purposes of exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the exclusive economic zone follow in essence the language of Article 56, paragraph 1(a) of the Convention. Chile, Mexico and Venezuela are some examples of this concordance. The fact that their legislation had followed earlier drafts of that article explains some of the small language variances, which do not alter the nature of the claim. This type of situation can be found in the legislation of Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Honduras. The Haitian Decree of 8 April 1977 purports to go further than the regime provided for under the 1982 Convention. It provides that Haiti will also exercise within its exclusive economic zone the controls necessary to "prevent violations of its health, fiscal, customs and immigration laws", in effect extending the jurisdiction applicable to the contiguous zone out to 200 miles.[^122] The recent law of Jamaica extends also to 200 miles the exercise of its rights in relation to archaeological objects,[^123] which goes beyond the limits encompassed in Article 303.

The general uniformity in national legislation, however, does not prevent differences in interpretation of certain provisions of the Convention, particularly when there is a need to harmonize national legislation with such provisions. Various declarations made by Latin American countries upon signing the Convention are evidence of this situation. While Brazil, which subsequently ratified the convention and changed its legislation, declared that the regime applied in practice was compatible with the Convention provisions,[^124] Uruguay declared such compatibility with the "main purposes and principles" underlying its legislation.[^125] Nicaragua more vaguely referred to the process of constitutional changes at that time taking place in the country.[^126] It should also be noted that Chile and Uruguay made declarations upon signing the Convention attempting to define the legal nature of the exclusive economic zone and underlining its sui generis aspect and the fact that its status is different from the territorial sea and the high seas.[^127]

#### 4.3.1 Navigation and Overflight

Latin American legislation has generally recognized the concepts of the freedom of navigation and overflight, and the laying of submarine cables and pipelines, as well as other associated freedoms, within their exclusive economic zone, but the specific rules to be applied are not normally spelled out. Some laws and regulations, such as those of Cuba and Mexico, expressly recognize the freedoms of other States, while others, such as Colombia and Haiti, have remained silent on the matter. This silence, however, should not be interpreted as having a negative implication since in practice there have been few difficulties in this regard.[^128]

There are some Latin American countries which still claim 200 mile territorial seas, with an adverse impact in principle upon the concept of freedom of navigation and overflight. But it should be noted that there have been few incidents lately and that the general evolution described above shows moderate approaches to their application.[^129]

Occasionally, there have been interpretations that tended to reinforce the rights of the coastal State in the exclusive economic zone, which were not compatible with other interpretations that would stress the freedom of navigation. At the signature of the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Article 17 of which allows, inter alia, for the adoption of measures in relation to ships exercising freedom of navigation with the prior authorization of the flag State, Brazil declared that that provision did not prevent a coastal State from requiring prior authorization for any action by other States under that article in its exclusive economic zone.[^130] In December 1989, the 12 States' members of the European Community individually filed objections to the Brazilian declaration, stating that it went "further than the rights accorded to coastal States by international law".[^131]

However, a restrictive approach has not always been followed in the context. In the quite recent "Canadian Reefer" case before the Chilean courts,[^132] the issue was whether the courts could exercise jurisdiction over a Norwegian ship which had collided with a Chilean fishing boat 40 miles offshore, causing the latter to sink and resulting in the death of most of its crew. An alleged aggravating factor was that the ship did not comply with the duty of rendering assistance and continued its onward journey. The plaintiff for the families of the victims and one survivor instituted criminal and civil proceedings before the Chilean courts. Several lower and higher courts upheld jurisdiction on the ground, inter alia, that Chilean nationals were the victims of such incident. The defendants entered a motion for dismissal in the light of the principles embodied in Article 97 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea which permit such proceedings only before the courts either of the flag State or of the State of which the master of the accused ship is a national. The Supreme Court finally ruled in favour of defendants in adjudicating a special recourse. There is in this case a striking similarity with the "Lotus" case,[^133] with the exclusive economic zone as the only major new factor. It should be noted, however, that an important ex gratia compensation was paid by the shipowners to the families of the victims.

The right to fly over the exclusive economic zone has not met with particular difficulties in Latin America, except in few and rather exception situations. Peru, as an extended territorial sea claimant, objected to the overflying of United States military aircraft in 1986, and both Cuba and Nicaragua have claimed eventual control over such overflight. Brazil made an unsuccessful effort in 1987 to have the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) address the issue of overflight over the exclusive economic zone in 1987, as an area separate from the high seas.[^134] The laying of submarine cables and pipelines is also a freedom fully recognized in the Latin American region.

The rights related to other internationally lawful uses of the sea referred to in Article 58 of the Convention have met with a more diversified reaction in Latin America because of their direct connection with the problem of military uses. Some legislation has expressly recognized these other rights or adopted similar broad formulations following the Convention language, cases in point being those of Cuba, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico and Venezuela.[^135] Guatemala has subjected these rights to the participation of a Government representative.[^136]

On the other hand, both Brazil and Uruguay made declarations on signing the convention, reiterated by the former also on ratifying it, to the effect that the Convention provisions do not entitle other States to undertake military exercises or manoeuvres in the exclusive economic zone - particularly those that imply the use of weapons or explosives - without the consent of the coastal States.[^137] Also Brazil has stated that Article 301 of the Convention, referring to the prohibition of the use of the force, applies in particular to maritime areas under the coastal States' sovereignty and jurisdiction.[^138] As explained above, the 200 mile territorial sea claimants have relied heavily on security considerations for justifying their policy.

#### 4.3.2 Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources

Provisions on fishing and conservation of living resources in the exclusive economic zone are most abundant in Latin America legislation, but not always the mechanisms established by the Convention find an expression in this context. The general objectives of management of fisheries, as set out in Articles 61 and 62 of the Convention, are barely mentioned in national legislation or only very general references are made to those objectives. While most legislation is silent on the matter, a few laws contain very general references, as for examples in the case of Peru. In only a few instances, such as Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and Venezuela, specific references is made to the concepts of total allowable catch and optimum utilization of resources.[^139]

Most of Latin American laws are also silent on the question of access by other states to the surplus in their exclusive economic zones. Only Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela have provided for such access either in general terms or by means of specific agreements.[^140] Bilateral agreements, such as those between Cuba and Mexico[^141] and Mexico and the United States[^142] have also followed a similar approach. As a consequence, neither of the criteria for allocation of the surplus have been elaborated upon. It should be noted, however, that no legislation forecloses fishing by other States in the exclusive economic zone if authorized under different mechanisms and procedures.

It is important therefore to examine the conditions for access to fishing, which are normally found in special laws and regulations on fishing. It is interesting to note, for example, that in this context Guatemala, unlike most other countries, refer to the duties of the coastal State in the exclusive economic zone; El Salvador and Guatemala require that a company be locally controlled in order to qualify for a fishing license; Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador and Uruguay have established zones for fishing operations with varying distances or locations; Brazil and Mexico have reserved lobster and shrimp fisheries for national fleets; El Salvador provided for priority in sale of catch for the supply of the local market; Brazil and Mexico prohibit the local landings by foreign vessels unless authorized; Argentina and Brazil require joint venture agreements for access by other States; elaborate reporting procedures are in effect in Brazil, Guatemala and Uruguay; most countries have empowered their defense forces for enforcement of fisheries legislation; and Costa Rica and El Salvador require special authorization for the passage of fishing vessels through their jurisdictional waters. It is also interesting to note that Uruguay requires reciprocity as a condition for granting access to foreign vessels.[^143]

A few countries in the region provide for imprisonment as a penalty for violating fishing legislation. Chile, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica are listed in this category although more recent legislation evidences a change in this regard. Lesser penalties are provided by most of other States, including Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Uruguay.[^144]

In short, the practice of States reveals that coastal States do not disregard or contradict the obligations of optimum utilization and other rules of the 1982 Convention in relation to the exclusive zone, but have naturally tended to take maximum advantage of the discretionary latitude which the Convention grants them. This is quite evident with regard to the determination of catch, the establishment of the surplus and the granting of eventual access.

### 4.4 Artificial Islands, Installations and Structures

The regime applicable to artificial islands, installations and structures in the exclusive economic zone has found a limited expression in Latin American law and practice. Firstly, it should be noted that many laws do not contain references to this matter. Some others, such as those of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Mexico have closely followed the language of Article 56, paragraph 1(b)(i) of the Convention with respect to the basic concept of coastal State jurisdiction in this matter. They have, however, referred to none of the detailed rules of the regime provided for under Article 60 of the Convention. Only Venezuela has legislation dealing with the basic concept and the specific regime embodied in those articles.[^145]

It would appear from the above that in Latin America, as elsewhere in the world, there is a trend to extend coastal State jurisdiction on this point by not exactly following the distinctions made in Article 60 of the Convention among various types of man-made island and structures. Furthermore, in their respective declarations upon signing the Convention, Brazil and Uruguay were quite explicitly in claiming jurisdiction over all kinds of such installations and structures, whatever their nature or purpose. Honduras also follows a similar approach.[^146] Such approach would bring under coastal State jurisdiction all kinds of devices placed in the exclusive economic zone, including those for military purposes. In the case of Venezuela the law allows for the possibility of establishing security zones of more than 500 meters.[^147]

### 4.5 Marine Scientific Research

Jurisdiction over scientific research is also usually included in the exclusive economic zone claims in Latin American States, as those of Guatemala[^148] and Mexico. But here again the provisions are merely in general terms, as those of Colombia[^149] and the Dominican Republic.[^150] Venezuela is one country that follows closely the provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Provisions on marine scientific research are normally found in specific legislation on the subject. Detailed information about the specific project, the institutions involved and the research team or crew is required by Argentina,[^151] as well as by Brazil[^152] which, by its legislation of 4 January 1993, confirms its exclusive right to conduct marine scientific research and requires its express consent for conducting any research. This is also the case, with varying degrees of details, of Chile,[^153] Ecuador,[^154] Mexico[^155] and Peru.[^156] In addition, Chile requires that coastal State scientists be invited aboard the research vessel whenever possible, while Brazil and Mexico have a mandatory policy in this regard. The six-month delay provided for in the Convention for the beginning of the project, after the pertinent information has been communicated, has been shortened to 60 days in the legislation of Ecuador.

### 4.6 Protection and Preservation of the Marine Environment

Most legislation in Latin America claims jurisdiction in relation to the protection of the marine environment, following the basic rules contained in Article 56 of the 1982 Convention. Only Colombia has claimed "exclusive jurisdiction"[^157] for the preservation of marine environment because its exclusive economic zone claim followed earlier drafts of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. No country in the region has claimed extensive potential powers in this field, as has happened elsewhere in the world, and the few that provide no specific limitations, e.g., Guatemala, Mexico and Venezuela have apparently done so without intention of extending their powers.

### 4.7 Continental Shelf

There is far less legislation on the continental shelf adopted since 1982 than that on the exclusive economic zone. This is a global phenomenon which also finds clear expression in Latin America.[^158] Since the enactment of the exclusive economic zone legislation, there are now two legal basis for coastal State rights in relation to the sea-bed: one is the continental shelf doctrine, and the other is the exclusive economic zone regime insofar as it also covers the sea-bed and sub-soil within the 200 mile distance. Most coastal States have relied on the exclusive economic zone legislation to ensure their rights to such sea-bed area. On the other hand, since the basic rules on the continental shelf have been firmly rooted in customary international law, some States may have felt that there was no great need to enact specific legislation in order to safeguard their rights.[^159] Another reason could be that the rights of the coastal State to the continental shelf are automatic and need not to be declared as it is the case of the exclusive economic zone.

Most countries in the region have not amended their traditional continental shelf legislation since the emergence of the exclusive economic zone. A few countries have specifically identified the continental shelf area with that of the exclusive economic zone, as Guatemala did in 1976.[^160] Some claims were made separately from the claim to an exclusive economic zone. This is the case of, e.g., Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago.[^161] Some States such as Haiti, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago[^162] still apply the exploitability test of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf. Nicaragua has claimed the full extension and natural prolongation of the continental shelf,[^163] while Costa Rica has claimed the continental shelf and the continental slope in accordance with the principles of international law.[^164] Brazil, in its law referred to above, Argentina,[^165] Mexico[^166] and the Dominican Republic[^167] have specifically adopted the language of Article 76, paragraph 1, of the 1982 Convention. In addition, Brazil specifies that the outer limits of the continental shelf will be established in accordance with Article 76.

From a conceptual point of view, none of these laws and regulations depart from the Convention, but there are in some cases difficult technical problems arising from the complex drafting of its Article 76.[^168]

On 15 September 1985, the Chilean Government issued a declaration claiming sovereignty over the continental shelf extending up to 350 miles for both Easter Island and the neighbouring island of Sala y Gomez, on the basis of Article 76, paragraph 6 of the Convention.[^169] The United States Government issued a protect, delivered in similar terms to both Chile and Ecuador, based on "customary international law on delimitation of the continental shelf as reflected in Article 76 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea".[^170] A somewhat similar protest was made by the former Federal Republic of Germany.[^171]

On 19 September 1985, Ecuador claimed the entire continental shelf extending from the South American continent to the Galapagos Islands.[^172] This proclamation involves, on the one hand, the 200 mile distance measured from the continent, and on the other hand, the 100 mile distance measured from the 2,500 meter isobath in the Galapagos Islands, with the combined effect of claiming the Carnegie Ridge and linking it up with the continental shelf attached to the continent. The Ecuadorian proclamation has also been the subject of United States and German protests.[^173]

In general, the functional nature of the coastal State rights over the continental shelf, which are limited to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources, is reflected in national legislation. The laws and regulations on oil and gas exploration and development, however, tend to treat the continental shelf as an integral part of the national territory. This trend may lead to a further expansion of coastal State rights over the shelf, as for example the inclusion of jurisdiction over shipwrecks. Marine scientific research, control of pollution and offshore installations, inter alia, have been already included in some of the most recent legislation, such as the Brazilian law of 4 January 1993 (Article 13).[^174]

## 5. Some Perspectives of the Brazilian Maritime Legal Policy

In Chapter 3, section 3.5, sub-section 3.5.1, we have discussed the position of Brazil with regard to the development of the law of the sea, under a historical perspective, since the political independence of the country, in 1822, until the period prior to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In the present Chapter we intend to focus on the legislation enacted by Brazil after signing the Convention - specially the Law No. 8.617 of 4 January 1993, which is in force - with the aim to harmonize its domestic regime with the provisions of the Convention.

After having followed an approach which could generally be identified with a territorialist policy, Brazil signed and later, on 22 December 1988, ratified the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (referred to in this Chapter as CLOS), with the declaration of compatibility of its domestic regime with the provisions of the Convention. At the same time, the Brazilian Constitution adopted on 5 October 1988 refers both to the territorial sea and the natural resources of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone as part of the public domain of the Union.

With regard to the breadth of the territorial sea, the Brazilian position was only clarified with the adoption on 4 January 1993 of the Law No. 8.617, on the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, which establishes a territorial sea of twelve nautical miles in breadth, measured from the low-water line along the Brazilian coast, as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by Brazil.

With respect to the drawing of baselines, the Brazilian law is in conformity with the traditional standards of international law and the provisions of the CLOS. Sole paragraph of Article 1 of Law No. 8.617 has followed Article 7(1) of the CLOS almost verbatim stating that in localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines, joining appropriate points, will be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.

Article 2 of the Law No. 8.617 sets out that the sovereignty of Brazil extends to the territorial sea, to the airspace over the territorial sea, as well as to its bed and subsoil. This provision harmonizes with the provisions found in Article 2(1) and (2) of the CLOS.

Concerning navigation and overflight in the territorial sea, since Brazil has clearly adopted the 12-mile territorial sea and 200-mile exclusive economic zone, few problems exist affecting the right of innocent passage or other rights recognized under international law. In other words, the right of innocent passage is respected throughout the territorial sea and there have been no particular incidents in this context. Article 3 of the Law No. 8.617 states that ships of all States enjoy the right of innocent passage through the Brazilian territorial sea.

Passage is considered innocent as long as it is not prejudicial to peace, good order or the security of Brazil and shall be continuous and expeditious (paragraph 1 of Article 3). Innocent passage may include stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force majeure or distress or for the purpose of rendering assistance to persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress (paragraph 2). In the Brazilian territorial sea, foreign ships are subject to the regulations established by the Brazilian Government (paragraph 3). These provisions, therefore, followed almost verbatim the provisions found in articles 17, 18 (2) and 19 (1) of the CLOS on innocent passage.

Neither has the entry of warships into the territorial sea been a contentious issue, with Brazil having claimed the right to control such entry. It should be noted, however, that specific legislation is somewhat vague on the requirement of prior authorization for the entry of warships. Brazil has not subjected warships carrying nuclear weapons to special controls or authorization, in spite of the opinion of some authors who have argued for such controls under the Treaty of Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. It is worthy to note that passage of vessels carrying hazardous waste has become recently an issue of concern in Brazil.

A contiguous zone has long been established in the law of Brazil. As discussed in Chapter 3, section 3.5, sub-section 3.5.1, notwithstanding the moves of the Brazilian delegation to the 1930 Hague Conference in favour of a six-mile territorial sea and against the institution of a contiguous zone, eight years later the Brazilian Government established a contiguous zone of twelve miles measured from the coast, which fundamentally applied to fishing.[^175]

In 1966, when the period of a six-mile territorial sea was inaugurated through the enactment of Decree Law No. 44, a six-mile contiguous zone was established for the purpose of enforcement jurisdiction on customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitary laws and regulations, but over which Brazil had "the same rights of fishing and of exploitation of the living resources of the sea enjoyed in the territorial sea".

Three years later, by means of Decree Law No. 553 of 25 April 1969, the territorial sea was enlarged to a belt of twelve nautical miles breadth, measured from the low-water line. Consequently, the contiguous zone regime was eliminated. Only twenty-four years later, with the enactment of the Law No. 8.617 of 4 January 1993 the contiguous zone regime was restored, in the light of Article 33 of the CLOS.

Under Article 4 of the Law No. 8.617 the Brazilian contiguous zone is a belt of sea which extends from twelve to twenty-four nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. Under Article 5, in the contiguous zone Brazil may exercise control to prevent infringement of the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea as well as punish this infringement.

As discussed earlier in Chapter 3, section 3.3, the concept of the exclusive economic zone (referred to in this Chapter as EEZ) found its origins in the Latin American and Caribbean law and practice of the 1940s and subsequent decades. Therefore, it is not surprising that an important number of countries in the region has enacted legislation relating to the EEZ as it emerged from the negotiations of the UNCLOS III. Brazil has formally incorporated the EEZ regime in its specific legislation.

According to Article 6 of the Law No. 8.617, which is based on Article 57 of the CLOS, the Brazilian EEZ is a belt of sea which extends from twelve to two hundred nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. In the EEZ, Brazil has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living and non-living, of the waters superjacent to the sea-bed, of the sea-bed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploration and exploitation of the zone (Article 7 of the Law No. 8.617, based on Article 56 (1)(a) of the CLOS).

Under Article 8 of the Law No. 8.617, in the EEZ Brazil, in exercising its jurisdiction, has the exclusive right to regulate marine scientific research, the protection and preservation of the marine environment, as well as the establishment, operation and use of all types of artificial islands, installations and structures. Such provision followed almost verbatim the provisions concerning rights, jurisdiction and duties of the coastal State in the EEZ found in Article 56 (1)(b) (i), (ii) and (iii) of CLOS.

With regard to navigation and overflight in the EEZ, Brazil has recognized the concepts of the freedom of navigation and overflight, as well as other associated freedoms. Specific rule to be applied is spelled out in Article 10 of the Law No. 8.617, which followed very closely the wording of Article 58 of the CLOS, with the exception of the laying of submarine cables and pipelines, a freedom provided for in the Convention to be enjoyed by other States within the EEZ but not contemplated in the Brazilian above-mentioned law.

With respect to the rights related to other internationally lawful uses of the sea referred to in Article 58 of the Convention, it is worthy to remember, as referred to supra in Chapter 4, section 4.3, sub-section 4.3.1, that they have met with a different reaction in Brazil, as well as in other Latin American countries, because of their direct connection with the problem of military uses. Upon signing the CLOS, Brazil made a declaration to the effect that the Convention provisions do not entitle other States to undertake military exercises or manoeuvres in its EEZ - particularly those that imply the use of weapons or explosives - without the consent of the coastal States. This declaration was reiterated by Brazil on ratifying the Convention.

In fact, Article 9 of the Law No. 8.617 spells out that in the EEZ, military exercises and manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, may only be carried out by other States with the consent of the Brazilian Government.

Brazil has also stated, on signing the Convention, that Article 301 of the CLOS, referring to the prohibition of the use of force, applies in particular to maritime areas under the coastal States sovereignty and jurisdiction.

Although the basic rules on the continental shelf have been firmly rooted in customary international law, Brazil, in its law referred to above has specifically adopted the language of Article 76, paragraph 1, of the CLOS. The continental shelf of Brazil comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance (Article 11 of the Law No. 8.617). In addition, Brazil specifies that the outer limits of the continental shelf will be established in accordance with Article 76 of the CLOS.

Brazil exercises over the shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources (Article 12 of the Law No. 8.617, which follows almost verbatim Article 77 of the CLOS).

Under Article 13 of the Law No. 8.617 Brazil confirms its exclusive right to regulate marine scientific research (and requires its express consent for conducting any research), the protection and preservation of the marine environment, as well as the construction, operation and use of all types of artificial islands, installations and structures, in the continental shelf. In addition, Brazil declares its exclusive right to authorize and to regulate drilling on the continental shelf, for any purpose.

All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf of Brazil. However, the delineation of the course for the laying of such cables and pipelines on the continental shelf is subject to the consent of the Brazilian Government. The Brazilian Government may also establish conditions for the laying of cables or pipelines entering its territory or territorial sea (Article 14, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Law No. 8.617, which are based on the provisions found in Article 79 of CLOS).

## 6. Conclusion

It is hoped that this dissertation has been able give an idea how the practice of Latin American States, in particular that of Brazil, has contributed to the development of the law of the sea. Bearing in mind that the Law of the Sea is not simply the result of a process of action and reaction among the most powerful countries but the product of the will of an overwhelming majority of nations from all parts of the world, at different levels of development, and having diverse geographical characteristics in relation to the oceans, it is true to say that each one of Latin American claims represented a new contribution in this evolutionary process.

One question that comes up to mind at the end of this study is why was the Third Law of the Sea Conference so successful? One brief answer certainly might be contained in the somewhat Chinese structure of the Four Ts: Timing, Tactics, Text and Togetherness.

With respect to **Timing**, the 1960s was a period of detente between the superpowers and also of decolonization. Developing countries were seeking ways to achieve greater economic, as well as political independence. They had created UNCTAD in 1964 but progress in making commodity agreements or securing markets for their first manufactured goods was slow, and the reliance on foreign aid for development was unsatisfactory and uncertain. The prospect of a source of automatic revenue, either from their future 200 mile economic zone or collectively through the Sea-Bed Authority from mining operations in the deep sea-bed, was alluring. While the maritime powers worried about their freedom of navigation, developing countries saw opportunities to gain a worthwhile share of the world's fisheries and the ocean's minerals.

In terms of **Tactics**, the organisation of this Third Law of the Sea Conference was a great advance on that other charter-drafting exercise, the San Francisco Conference of 1945. Although the superpowers were active in all the committees, they did not hold any of the main posts at the conference and so escaped any great criticism of high-handedness (at least until 1980). Before the conference began, it was agreed that negotiations should proceed by consensus, and that the objective was a package deal: there was to be no winning around, as in a card game; until everything was in place, none of the points that might have been tentatively agreed would be considered finally settled. Again, the use of negotiating groups (formal and informal) and working groups and the "miniaturizing" of negotiations from a forum of 160 delegations allowed for flexibility, while the establishment of a 6 member "collegium" imposed control over the later stages.

How the **Text** came to be assembled was, of course, crucial. The idea of a "single negotiating text", which went through various stages of revision and consolidation, was original. It was not deliberately planned from the beginning. It was a stroke of genius produced at a time of confusion by the conference's first president, Shirley Amerasinghe. The "negotiating text" was not a draft treaty, but more than a set of working papers. Nobody was committed to its phrases, at the outset; but from being a compendium of articles prepared by committee chairmen it gradually evolved into a collectively molded document. Then the stage was reached when it was agreed that no changes should be made to it unless the amendments moved the conference substantially closer to consensus. Finally, it became accepted as the draft treaty. Its evolution was quite subtle.

Finally, the human factor of **Togetherness**. Many countries made the wise decision to assign a particular person (usually a lawyer) as chief negotiator "for the duration". Some big countries - the United States, Britain and then West Germany among them - failed to do so and suffered the consequences. In contrast, those which enjoyed this continuity of leadership achieved more clout than they might normally expect to have internationally: for example, countries like Chile and Ireland, Australia and Kenya, Fiji and Canada. They knew the by-ways of the text, what had already been tried and failed, the time and means to introduce a new idea and a possible solution. They were also known to each other; and friends negotiated as much as countries. This camaraderie involved, after a time, a determination to "see it through to the end". A momentum was built up for success. Having invested so much time and brain-power and having achieved many elements of a draft treaty, extra determination was then summoned to clinch it. At the centre of this many-sided operation, a "critical mass" of about 80 talented individuals carried the conference.

Tommy T.B. Koh, of Singapore, President of the UNCLOS III, put this important point in a speech at the signing session in Montego Bay.

> In the final analysis, I believe that this Conference succeeded because it brought together a "critical mass" of colleagues who were outstanding lawyers and negotiators. We succeeded because we did not regard our counterparts in the negotiations as the enemies to be conquered. We considered the issues under dispute as the common obstacles to be overcome. We worked not only to promote our individual national interests, but also in pursuit of our common dream of writing a constitution for the oceans.[^177]

Certainly there is an inequitable division between States, and some of them enjoy in jackpot quantities the lack of geography and geology. Then, there is inequity in national land boundaries, in the size of a country's population, in its degree of social and economic development. In fact, there is no way to alter all these imbalances by a single treaty, but the 1982 Convention contains generally acceptable solutions with respect to the maritime spaces under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of States, the rational utilization of living and non-living resources, the rights of land-locked States, the promotion of marine scientific research as an instrument for the economic and social development of all peoples, the conservation of the marine environment, respect for the freedoms which have traditionally been observed insofar as the community as a whole is concerned and the settlement by peaceful means of disputes concerning ocean spaces.

Actually, what most developing countries have gained are sovereign rights and control over areas which other countries (richer than they are) could previously plunder at will. What the world as a whole has gained is the undertaking of responsibilities by coastal States for one-third of the oceans, where previously all the talk was about "freedom" and there was dangerous little consideration given to the management and conservation of natural resources.

To finalize, it is important to say that now that the 1982 Convention is in force, there is a challenge to present and to younger generations to make the Law of the Sea a reality and make it gain a reputation of efficiency through the mechanisms it has established.

[^3]: In 1990, in an effort to achieve universal participation in the 1982 Convention, necessary for the establishment and financing of the International Sea-Bed Authority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, as provided for in the Convention, the Secretary-General took the initiative to convene informal consultations aimed at addressing issues of concern for those States. Several rounds of consultations have made it possible for States to identify issues and several areas of general agreement. Finally in 1994, a solution was found by reviewing certain provisions of the 1982 Convention, producing a supplementary agreement - the Agreement Relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 - which was adopted by the 48th General Assembly of the United Nations on 28 July 1994, and concluded at New York on 29 July 1994.

[^5]: An important procedural device at the Conference was the preparation of informal "negotiating texts" as a basis for discussion, first of which was presented in 1974. In 1975, the Conference requested the Chairmen of its Committees to prepare negotiating texts, which resulted in the ISNT (Informal Single Negotiating Text) to which "Working Paper 9" on the settlements of disputes was later attached. Its revision produced the RSNT (Revised Single Negotiating Text). Further discussions led to the consolidation of the texts into "Working Paper 10" - the ICNT (Informal Composite Negotiating Text) - subsequently revised thrice by a "collegium" composed of the President and the Chairmen of the main committees. In 1981, the "collegium" recognized that the fourth revision of the "Working Paper 10" - DC (Draft Convention) 1981 - had a higher "status" than its predecessors and proposed that it should not be an informal text but the Conference's official Draft Convention.

[^53]: R. Zacklin, op.cit., p. 67.

[^54]: The expression "epicontinental sea" was first employed by Argentina as early as 1946. Decree No. 14.708 declared the sovereignty of the nation over the Argentinean epicontinental sea and continental shelf. The epicontinental sea is that part of the sea superjacent to the shelf. Article 2 further defined the legal character of the epicontinental sea by expressly stating that freedom of navigation was not affected by the decree. The Argentinean degree was based on an erroneous interpretation of the 1945 Truman Declaration which, while extending jurisdiction and control over the resources of the continental shelf, did not modify the legal character of the superjacent waters. Although the epicontinental sea conception was endorsed some years later by a meeting of Central American Foreign Ministers, it has never met with wide adoption. The concept of the complementary sea emerged from the Second Hispano-Luso-American Congress of International Law, held in Sao Paulo in October 1953, the final Act of which contained a provision conferring upon those States which had no continental shelf the right to regulate fishing in zones of the high seas adjacent to the territorial sea to a distance of 200 miles. This zone is referred to as the complementary sea. See R. Zacklin, op.cit., p. 77.

[^71]: The Hovering Acts - from which the Contiguous Zone concept originated - were enacted in 1736 by Great Britain against foreign smuggling ships hovering within distances of up to 24 miles from the shore. These Acts, which had effect from 1736 until their repeal by the 1876 Customs Consolidation Act, were at the time regarded as permitted by "the common courtesy of nations for their convenience", as Lord Stowell put it in the case of LE LOUIS in 1817. By mid-nineteenth century, when the three-mile limit for the territorial sea, combined with the exclusivity of flag State jurisdiction on the high seas beyond, was well established in Anglo-American practice and served well the interests of free navigation, Great Britain recognised that its wider customs zones were inconsistent with the three-mile rule. The seizure of the French ship the PETIT JULES 23 miles off the Isle of Wight in 1850 was the last occasion on which the Hovering Acts were enforced against a foreign vessel beyond the marine league.

[^72]: Fishing Code approved by Decree No. 23.672 of 2 January 1934, and confirmed by Decree-Law No. 794 of 19 October 1938, which amended the Code.

[^73]: The Inter-American Council of Jurists (hereinafter referred to as the IACJ) was one of the organs of the Council of the Organization of American States (OAS). The IACJ, at which all OAS members were represented, had the task of serving as a consultative body on juridical matters, of promoting the development and codification of public international law and private international law, as well as of studying the possibility of informing the domestic legislations of the different American countries in whatever field it might be deemed convenient. From the above description it is clear that the IACJ was the OAS's equivalent of the UN General Assembly's subsidiary organ, the International Law Commission (ILC). The IACJ held five meetings (Rio 1950, Buenos Aires 1953, Mexico 1956, Santiago 1959 and San Salvador 1965), before it was abolished in 1967.

[^75]: The Inter-American Juridical Committee (hereinafter referred to as the IAJC) was the IACJ's permanent body, with headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. The IAJC was integrated by nine jurists of different countries, appointed by the Inter-American Conference - one of the organs of OAS - who represented all members of the OAS. The IAJC's functions were to initiate preparatory works and studies entrusted to it by the IACJ, the Inter-American Conference, the Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers or the Council of the Organization, although it could initiate on its own. When the Charter of the OAS was amended through the 1967 Buenos Aires Protocol, the IACJ, inter alia, was abolished and replaced by the IAJC, and the number of its jurists rose to eleven, to be appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographic representation.
